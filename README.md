Software Engineering Group Project

This was a final project completed for CIS 350 (Software Engineering & Design) at the University of Pennsylvania.
The project is an Android app designed to allow users to keep track of their plant collections and gardens. 
Botanist supports the creation of a personal database of plants. The app allows the user to keep track of feeding/watering schedules
for the plants, take pictures, and look up additional information on the internet.

This project was a collaborative effort with Jacqueline Askins, Katherine Dix, and Benjamin Shapiro.
